## Usage

1. **Open `index.html` in your web browser** (no installation required).
2. Enter a chemical equation (e.g., `H2 + O2 → H2O`) in the input box.
3. Click **Analyze** to see atom counts and steps.
4. Click **Balance** to balance the equation (for supported examples).
5. Use **Show Formation** for an animated reaction visualization.
6. Explore the **Periodic Table** or try the **Quiz Mode** for extra learning.
7. Ask the **AI Chemistry Assistant** any chemistry question!

## Example Equations
- `H2 + O2 → H2O` (Water formation)
- `CH4 + O2 → CO2 + H2O` (Combustion)
- `NaCl + AgNO3 → AgCl + NaNO3` (Double displacement)
- `N2 + H2 → NH3` (Ammonia synthesis)
- `CaCO3 → CaO + CO2` (Decomposition)

## Keyboard Shortcuts
- **Ctrl+Enter**: Analyze equation
- **Ctrl+B**: Balance equation
